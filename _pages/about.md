I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore, where I work with Professor [Yan Shuo Tan](https://sites.google.com/view/yanshuotan/home). I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [School of Statistics](https://stat.ruc.edu.cn/Home/index.htm), Renmin University of China, in 2023, under the supervision of Professor [Hanfang Yang](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/English/Faculty/75f7b9495f664db2b47dce10253a84ff.htm). Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.xmu.edu.cn/en/) at Xiamen University in 2018.

Research Interests
-----
- Tree-based methods: Theory and methodology for tree-based models, emphasizing on the benefits of ensembling in random forests.
- Bagged nearest neighbors estimators: Statistical properties and computational efficiency of bagging procedures for large-scale data.
- Unsupervised learning: Developing new methods with statistical guarantees for problems such as anomaly detection and data imputation.
